# Cubrices

A Python implementation of 3D matrices or cubrices (not to be confused with tensors).

Further information on cubrix theory can be found on the paper in [this other repo](https://github.com/erikucenik/cubrices-paper).

# Requirements

- `python3.10` or higher.

# Quickstart

The file `main.py` displays pretty much every detail of the `cubrices.py` module.

You can just open it and play around with it.

If any doubts arise, they'll probably be fixed by either the `help(cubrices)` function
or [the aforementioned paper](https://github.com/erikucenik/cubrices-paper).
